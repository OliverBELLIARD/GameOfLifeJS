## How to play

The concept is pretty simple. Open the file `index.html` with the browser of your choice and the game will show automatically.
It contains a grid and the game allows to place cells.
- The game progresses automatically so everything is automatic.
- Cells can be placed with the mouse by doing a right or left click.
- The game loop can be paused with the space bar allowing to draw a bigger number of cells.
